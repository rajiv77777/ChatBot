# ChatBot
Chat-Bot based on Information retrieval is focused on processing a user query
from a given set of documents. The complexity of natural language will make it
very difficult to access the information in the text. Therefore, Natural Language
processing came into the picture. This project is mainly useful for students to
ask queries and it is helpful to know the college details without any physical
contact. Text to speech conversion provides a better way of interaction with the
user, e.g. google assistant. Users can go either for text-based information
retrieval or voice-based retrieval. The text-based and voice-based retrieval
output is based on the keywords used. NLTK uses tokenization, steaming and
Lemmatization of keywords, by matching them with the document. This project
helps people to clarify their doubts most easily and reduces manpower and time.
